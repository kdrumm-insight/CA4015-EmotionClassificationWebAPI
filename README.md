# CA4015-SentimentAnalysisWebAPI
 The following repository contains the source code for a Flask-based web API implementing the logic necessary to interact with a sentiment analysis model. It accepts a piece of text as input and returns a sentiment categorization for that text.

 In order to run this web API, some form of IDE that supports Python will be required. We recommend PyCharm Community (https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download/?section=windows).
 
 Once this project has been loaded into PyCharm, this web API can be run using the instructions detailed here: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/quickstart/.
